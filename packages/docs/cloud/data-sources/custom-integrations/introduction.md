# Custom Integrations

Orama Cloud provides a growing number of custom integrations with popular CMSs, eCommerce platforms, and other web applications.

Even though, if you want to connect Orama to a proprietary or custom software, you can use our **custom integration system** to feed Orama with your data.

## How it works

As for today, we support 4 different ways to feed Orama with your data:

- [JSON File Upload](./json-file)
- [CSV FIle Upload](./csv-file)
- [REST API](./rest-api)
- [WebHooks](./webhooks) (work in progress)

You can use any of the above methods to feed Orama with your data. You can even use all of them at the same time on different indexes.

For example, you can use the JSON File Upload to feed the `products` index and the REST API to feed the `blog` index.

With custom data sources, you choose how to feed Orama with your data.
