# Delete an index

Deleting an existing index is a very simple and immediate operation.

From your dashboard homepage, select the index you want to delete. In our case, we'll select the only one available:

<ZoomImg
  src='/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/indexes-list.png'
  alt='Indexes list'
/>

Once you're in edit mode, you can click on "delete" on the left side of the screen:

<ZoomImg
  src='/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/edit-index.png'
  alt='Index in edit mode'
/>

When clicking on "delete", a popup window will appear asking you for confirmation:

<ZoomImg
  src='/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/delete.png'
  alt='Index in delete mode'
/>

After confirming that you want to delete the index, Orama will proceed with its elimitaion.

This procedure will take a few seconds and is irreversible, so please proceed with caution.
