# Getting started

## Installing Lyra

Lyra can be installed using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` as follows:

```sh
npm i @nearform/lyra
```

```sh
yarn add @nearform/lyra
```

```sh
pnpm add @nearform/lyra
```

Once Lyra is installed, you can easily import in any project.
Lyra exposes its own types, **ESM** modules, and **CJS** modules.

Once you're ready, you can start [creating a database](./creating-a-database.md).
