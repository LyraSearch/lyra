</Aside>

Deleting an existing index is a very simple and immediate operation.

From your <a href="https://cloud.orama.com/indexes" target="_blank">dashboard homepage</a>, select the index you want to delete. In our case, we'll select the only one available:

  alt="Indexes list"
/>

Once you're in edit mode, you can click on "delete" on the left side of the screen:

<img
  src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/edit-index.png"
  alt="Index in edit mode"
/>

When clicking on "**Delete**", a popup window will appear asking you for confirmation:

<img
  src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/delete.png"
  alt="Index in delete mode"
/>

After confirming that you want to delete the index, Orama Cloud will proceed with its elimitaion.

This procedure will take a few seconds and is **irreversible**, so please proceed with caution.
