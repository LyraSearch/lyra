Creating a new index is extremely simple. When creating your first index, you have the option to:
- import a static file (either [JSON](/cloud/data-sources/static-files/json-file) or [CSV](/cloud/data-sources/static-files/csv-file))
- connect to an e-commerce platform (we currently support [Shopify](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify) and [Elasticpath](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath))
- install a native plugin for your app (like [Strapi](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/strapi) or [Docusaurus](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus))
- or implement your custom HTTP integration by connecting your Orama Cloud Index using [Remote JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/remote-json) or [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis) datasources and our [Official SDKs](/cloud/performing-search/official-sdk).

## Tutorial

For this guide, we will use a JSON file. You can follow along using [this dataset](/cloud/guides/example-datasets/games.json).

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Let's start. Click on "Import from files", and complete the next screen as you prefer.</p>
      <img
        src='/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/uploading-a-file.png'
        alt='Choosing the JSON data source on Orama Cloud'
        class="mx-10"
      />
      <p class="pl-10">Once you click on "Create index", Orama will create an empty index for you.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/empty-index.png"
        alt="Empty Orama index"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Here you can upload a JSON file, and Orama will show you a _preview_ of the first document found in it. You can use this information to write the searchable properties schema.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/writing-the-schema.png"
        alt="Writing the searchable properties schema"
        class="mx-10"
      />
      <br />
      <p class="pl-10">Remember that you can only perform search and filter through properties that are present in the search schema.<br /><br />
      To make Orama faster, read the [Optimizing Orama: Schema Optimization](https://orama.com/blog/optimizing-orama-schema-optimization) article on our blog.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Now you only need to determine how you want to perform vector/hybrid search on your index. You can use Orama embedding models or OpenAI ones. Refer to [Embeddings Generation](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation#automatic-embeddings-generation) to learn more about this feature.<br /><br />
      If you're unsure about which model to use, we recommend using the **Orama AI** embeddings, as they are free, faster and more optimized than OpenAI's.<br /><br />
      `orama/gte-small` is the default embedding model, and we highly recommend using this model for most use cases. If you need more powerful embeddings, you can use the `orama/gte-medium` or `orama/gte-large` models, as well as OpenAI's ones.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/automatic-embeddings-generation.png"
        alt="Automatic embeddings generation"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Once you selected the properties to generate the embeddings from, click on "Save and deploy" to release your index.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/deploy.png"
        alt="Deploying Orama"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">After the deployment process is finished, you'll be able to see an endpoint and a public API key. You can use these two parameters for performing search using the [Orama Client SDK](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/javascript-sdk).<br /><br />
      To update your index, simply upload a new JSON file with the same schema (or edit the schema accordingly with your new data) and click on "**Save and deploy**" again.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>
