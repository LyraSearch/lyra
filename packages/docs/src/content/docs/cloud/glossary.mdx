Orama Cloud is a next-gen search and answer engine that helps you create a high-performance answer engine for your website or application. This glossary will help you understand the terms used in this documentation.

##### Answer Engine

An answer engine is a software system that provides answers to questions asked by users. The answer engine processes the user's question and generates the most relevant answer from the indexed data in real-time.

##### Data Source

A data source is where the data comes from. It can be a database, a file, a web page, or any other source of data. The data source is where the search engine gets the data to index and search.

##### Deployment

Deployment is the process of making your search engine live and available to users. Orama Cloud indexes are immutable, so you need to trigger a new deployment every time you make changes to your index. When you deploy your index, it becomes accessible to your users.

##### Document

A document is a piece of data that the search engine indexes and searches. A document can be a web page, a blog post, a product, a user profile, or any other piece of data that you want to make searchable.

##### Index

An index is a collection of documents that are searchable and retrievable by the search engine. The index is the core of the search engine, and it is where the search engine stores and retrieves the documents.

##### Search Engine

A search engine is a software system that searches for and retrieves information from a database or index. The search engine processes the search query and returns the relevant documents to the user.

##### Search Query

A search query is a request for information that the user submits to the search engine. The search query can be a keyword, a phrase, or a question. The search engine processes the search query and returns the relevant documents to the user.

##### SDK

A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build software applications. The SDK provides the necessary resources to interact with the software system and build custom applications.
