Orama Cloud offers a rich variety of Native integrations and plugins that helps you integrate with your app with ease. When available, we suggest using native integrations over custom integrations, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

Integrating is very straight-forward. Install the plugin for your application, CMS or E-commerce platform. If your platform is not listed, you can always build a [custom integration](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations) using [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis).

      title: 'Docusaurus',
      description: 'Install a plugin to index your documentation contents.',
    },
    {
      thumbnail: import('../../../../../assets/og-bg.png'),
      href: '/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath',
      title: 'Elasticpath',
      description: 'Connect your Elasticpath store to Orama Cloud.',
    },
  ]}
/>

With Orama Cloud, you can integrate with every external system, library, and API.

While we let you build your own integrations via our [custom integrations](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/) feature, we also provide a set of native integrations that you can use out of the box.

At the time of writing this, we have the following plugins:

- [**Docusaurus**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus)
- [**Elasticpath**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath)
- [**Shopify**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify)
- [**Strapi**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/strapi)

When available, we suggest using **native integrations** over **custom integrations**, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

We're working on adding more plugins, so if you have any suggestions...<br />please let us know at [info@orama.com](mailto:info@orama.com).
