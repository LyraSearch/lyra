With Orama Cloud, you can integrate with every external system, library, and API.

While we let you build your own integrations via our [custom integrations](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/) feature, we also provide a set of native integrations that you can use out of the box.

At the time of writing this, we have the following plugins:

- [**Docusaurus**](/cloud/data-sources/native-plugins/docusaurus)
- [**Elasticpath**](/cloud/data-sources/native-plugins/elasticpath)
- [**Shopify**](/cloud/data-sources/native-plugins/shopify)
- [**Strapi**](/cloud/data-sources/native-plugins/strapi)

When available, we suggest using **native integrations** over **custom integrations**, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

We're working on adding more plugins, so if you have any suggestions...<br />please let us know at [info@orama.com](mailto:info@orama.com).
