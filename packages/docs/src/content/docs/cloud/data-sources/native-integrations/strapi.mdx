We provide a plugin for Strapi that allows you to connect your Strapi application to Orama Cloud and index your content in a few simple steps.

## Install plugin

To get started, you need to install the Orama Cloud plugin in your Strapi application.

#### Using the marketplace

Coming soon.

#### Using a package manager

You can install the plugin using any major Node.js package manager.

<Install pkg="@oramacloud/plugin-strapi" />

### Configuration

To use the plugin, you need to add the following configuration to your `config/plugins.js` file.

<Code lang="js" title="config/plugins.js" code={`
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  "orama-cloud": {
    config: {
      privateApiKey: env('ORAMACLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY'),
    },
  },
});
`} />

You can get the `privateApiKey` from your Orama Cloud dashboard. It is required to authenticate your Strapi application with Orama Cloud.

<Aside type="caution">
  Keep your private API key in a **secure** place. Do not share it with anyone and **do not expose it** in your client-side code or public repository.
</Aside>

## Creating an index

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Go to a project in your [dashboard](https://cloud.orama.com), and click on "Add index" and then "Native Integrations".</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Then, click on the **Strapi** logo to create a new index.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Add a name to your index. It can be anything.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Click **Create index** to continue.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">In the following screen, you will be presented with the variables you need to set up the plugin.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Follow the instructions on the dashboard to get your `PRIVATE_API_KEY`.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>

## Managing your indexes

The Orama Cloud plugin for Strapi allows you to manage **one or more indexes** directly from your Strapi admin panel.

Directly from the Strapi plugin's admin panel, you can:

- [Add a collection](#add-a-collection) to map your Strapi `Content Type` to an Orama Cloud index.
- [Define the schema](#define-the-schema) of your index.
- Define the [update strategy](#update-settings) for your index.

### Add a collection

  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/strapi-plugin.jpg"
  alt="Strapi plugin"
  class="p-5"
/>

| Option           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Index ID**     | **(required)** The index ID you want to connect to. You can find the Index ID in the dashboard. |
| **Content Type** | **(required)** The Strapi Content Type you want to map to your Orama Index. |
| **Include relations** | Include Content Type relations as nested objects in your index documents. |
| **Attributes mapping** | **(required)** Define the attributes to be included in your index documents. |
| **Searchable properties** | In the attributes mapping section, you can toggle the attributes that should be used in search queries. |

### Defining the schema

In the collection configuration modal, under the **Attributes mapping** section, you can select the attributes of your Strapi `Content Type` that you want to include in your search documents (the records that will be indexed in Orama Cloud).

<img 
  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/define-schema.jpg" 
  alt="Strapi plugin - Attributes mapping" 
  class="p-5"
/>

This is where you also define the `Searchable properties` of your index. These are the attributes that will be searchable in your index. The searchable properties are also used in the automatic [embeddings generation](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation) to perform vector and hybrid searches.

### Update settings

To define how your index should be updated, you can either enable **Live updates** or **Scheduled updates**. Depending on your use case, you can choose to update your index in real-time or at specific intervals.

#### Live updates

Live updates will automatically update your index whenever a new record is created, updated, or deleted in your Strapi application. This will automatically trigger a reindexing process and a new deployment in Orama Cloud.

<img
  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/live-updates.jpg"
  alt="Strapi plugin - Live updates"
  class="p-5"
/>

This option is useful when you want to keep your index up-to-date with your Strapi application in real-time. However, it may increase the number of deployments in Orama Cloud. 

To keep the number of deployments low, you can use the **Scheduled updates** option.

#### Scheduled updates

Scheduled updates allow you to define a specific interval for updating your index. You can choose to update your index every 30 minutes, every hour, daily, weekly or monthly.

<img
  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/scheduled-updates.jpg"
  alt="Strapi plugin - Scheduled updates"
  class="p-5"
/>

This option is useful when you want to keep your index up-to-date with your Strapi application but don't need real-time updates. Scheduled updates can help you reduce the number of deployments in Orama Cloud.

## Advanced usage

### Documents transformation
The scope of the transformation is to modify the document before it is sent to the Orama Cloud API. This can be useful to add, remove or modify fields in the document.
A common use case is to refactor a collection _(not supported yet by Orama Cloud)_ into a flat structure.\
Here is an example of how to transform a collection of objects to a flat structure:

<Aside type="note">
  This will override any setting you have in the Strapi plugin admin panel.\
  You'll be warned on the admin panel if you have a transformer function set.
</Aside>

#### Pre-requisites
- An Orama Cloud index.
- A Strapi collection already created, with relations.

Example document:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "owner": "John",
  "cars": [
    {
      "brand": "Toyota",
      "model": "Corolla"
    },
    {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Focus"
    }
  ]
}
```
You can insert your transformer function directly inside the plugin configuration under `config/plugins.js` file:

<Aside type="caution">
  Remember that both `schema` and `transformer` are mandatory for a correct configuration. If you miss one of them, the plugin will not work as expected.\
  Also remember that the `transformer` function must return a transformed document that follows the schema you defined.\
  All non-matching fields will included in the documents, but ignored as search field.
</Aside>

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  "orama-cloud": {
    config: {
      privateApiKey: env("ORAMA_PRIVATE_API_KEY"),
      collectionSettings: {
        "<your_collection_index_id>": {
          /* Mandatory */
          /* Define the schema of your document */
          schema: {
            id: { type: "integer" },
            owner: { type: "string" },
            cars: {
              brands: { type: "string" },
              models: { type: "string" },
            }
          },
          /* Mandatory */
          /* Define the transformer function */
          transformer: entry => {
            return {
              ...entry,
              owner: "Overriding owner",
              cars: {
                source: entry.cars,
                ...entry.cars.reduce((acc, curr) => {
                  acc.brands.push(curr.brand);
                  acc.models.push(curr.model);
                  return acc;
                }, {
                  brands: [],
                  models: []
                })
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

In this way your cars will be transformed to:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "owner": "Overriding owner",
  "cars": {
    "brands": ["Toyota", "Ford"],
    "models": ["Corolla", "Focus"]
  }
}
```
And this will make you car brands and models searchable.
