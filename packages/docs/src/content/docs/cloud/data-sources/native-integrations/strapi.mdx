We provide a plugin for Strapi that allows you to connect your Strapi application to Orama Cloud and index your content in a few simple steps.

## Install plugin

To get started, you need to install the Orama Cloud plugin in your Strapi application.

#### Using the marketplace

Coming soon.

#### Using a package manager

You can install the plugin using any major Node.js package manager.

<Install pkg="@oramacloud/plugin-strapi" />

### Configuration

To use the plugin, you need to add the following configuration to your `config/plugins.js` file.

<Code lang="js" title="config/plugins.js" code={`
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  "orama-cloud": {
    config: {
      privateApiKey: env('ORAMACLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY'),
    },
  },
});
`} />

You can get the `privateApiKey` from your Orama Cloud dashboard. It is required to authenticate your Strapi application with Orama Cloud.

<Aside type="caution">
  Keep your private API key in a **secure** place. Do not share it with anyone and **do not expose it** in your client-side code or public repository.
</Aside>

## Creating an index

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Go to your [dashboard](https://cloud.orama.com/indexes) and click on "Native Integrations".</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Then, click on the **Strapi** logo to create a new index.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Add a name to your index. It can be anything.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Click **Create index** to continue.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">In the following screen, you will be presented with the variables you need to set up the plugin.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Follow the instructions on the dashboard to get your `PRIVATE_API_KEY`.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>

## Managing your indexes

The Orama Cloud plugin for Strapi allows you to manage **one or more indexes** directly from your Strapi admin panel.

Directly from the Strapi plugin's admin panel, you can:

- [Add a collection](#add-a-collection) to map your Strapi `Content Type` to an Orama Cloud index.
- [Define the schema](#define-the-schema) of your index.
- Define the [update strategy](#update-settings) for your index.

### Add a collection

  alt="Strapi plugin"

/>

| Option           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Index ID**     | **(required)** The index ID you want to connect to. You can find the Index ID in the dashboard. |
| **Content Type** | **(required)** The Strapi Content Type you want to map to your Orama Index. |
| **Include relations** | Include Content Type relations as nested objects in your index documents. |
| **Attributes mapping** | **(required)** Define the attributes to be included in your index documents. |
| **Searchable properties** | In the attributes mapping section, you can toggle the attributes that should be used in search queries. |

### Defining the schema

In the collection configuration modal, under the **Attributes mapping** section, you can select the attributes of your Strapi `Content Type` that you want to include in your search documents (the records that will be indexed in Orama Cloud).

<img 
  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/define-schema.jpg" 
  alt="Strapi plugin - Attributes mapping" 
  class="p-5"
/>

This is where you also define the `Searchable properties` of your index. These are the attributes that will be searchable in your index. The searchable properties are also used in the automatic [embeddings generation](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation) to perform vector and hybrid searches.

### Update settings

To define how your index should be updated, you can either enable **Live updates** or **Scheduled updates**. Depending on your use case, you can choose to update your index in real-time or at specific intervals.

#### Live updates

Live updates will automatically update your index whenever a new record is created, updated, or deleted in your Strapi application. This will automatically trigger a reindexing process and a new deployment in Orama Cloud.

<img
  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/live-updates.jpg"
  alt="Strapi plugin - Live updates"
  class="p-5"
/>

This option is useful when you want to keep your index up-to-date with your Strapi application in real-time. However, it may increase the number of deployments in Orama Cloud. 

To keep the number of deployments low, you can use the **Scheduled updates** option.

#### Scheduled updates

Scheduled updates allow you to define a specific interval for updating your index. You can choose to update your index every 30 minutes, every hour, daily, weekly or monthly.

<img
  src="/cloud/guides/strapi/scheduled-updates.jpg"
  alt="Strapi plugin - Scheduled updates"
  class="p-5"
/>

This option is useful when you want to keep your index up-to-date with your Strapi application but don't need real-time updates. Scheduled updates can help you reduce the number of deployments in Orama Cloud.
