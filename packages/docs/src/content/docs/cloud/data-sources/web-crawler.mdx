If you are looking for an alternative data source to integrate with Orama Cloud, you can use our <a href="https://cloud.orama.com/indexes/create/from-website" target="_blank">Web Crawler</a> to index the contents of your website. This is particularly useful when you want to index a website that does not provide an API.

<Aside type="note">
The Web Crawler is a tool meant to be used to index the contents of a website you own. <br />
**Do not use it** to crawl websites you do not own or have permission to crawl. 
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Be careful when using this data source, as it can be resource-intensive and may not be suitable for all use cases. The Web Crawler is a powerful tool that can be used to index the contents of a website in few clicks. However, it can lead to unpredictable results if not used correctly.

### Troubleshooting

Check out the logs displayed in the dashboard to see if there are any errors. 

Firstly, verify that the website URL is correct and accessible. Also, make sure that the index configuration, including the `Excluding URL path patterns` option. 

Large websites with many pages can take a long time to index. In some cases, the Web Crawler may not be able to index all the pages due to the website's structure or limitations.

If you are still having trouble, please reach out to our [Slack](https://orama.to/slack) for support.

### Integrating into your app

Now that you have your index deployed, you can start using it in your app.

Orama Cloud provides Official SDKs for JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, PHP and Python. You can use it to query your data (and much more).
