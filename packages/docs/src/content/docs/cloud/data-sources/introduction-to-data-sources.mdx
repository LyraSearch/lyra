One important concept to understand when working with **Orama Cloud**, is the concept of **data source**. A data source, as the name suggests, refers to the original source from which data is derived. This could be a database, a web service, a JSON file, or any other platform that generates and stores data.

Orama Cloud offers built-in integrations with [Shopify](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify), [Docusaurus](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus), and [Elasticpath](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath), and continues to expand its native integrations to additional platforms.

If you're interested in integrating **Orama Cloud** into a project, but your data source isn't included in the list of [native integrations](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/), don't fret! You can always utilize the [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis) and [Remote JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/remote-json) to supply Orama with your own data.

## Choosing the right Data Source

Connecting to a native plugin data source is straight-forward. For instance, connecting to [Shopify](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify) only involves a few steps (you can find the full documentation [here](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify)). Likewise, connecting to a custom data source is also quite simple.

### Static Files

You can easily upload any [JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/json-file) or [CSV](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/csv-file) files and index their data in just a few clicks. This feature is particularly useful when you want to test an Orama Cloud indexes with a database dump or a spreadsheet export.

    },

    },

### Native Plugins

Orama Cloud offers a rich variety of Native Plugins that helps you integrate with your app with ease. When available, we suggest using native integrations over custom integrations, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

Integrating is very straightforward. Install our plugin on your current application, CMS or E-commerce platform, such as [Shopify](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify), [Docusaurus](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus) or [Strapi](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus).

Find out more [Native Plugins](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/).

### Custom Integrations

If you need to regularly update the Orama Cloud index for production-grade workflows, or on a demand basis, we highly recommend considering feeding your index via [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis).

This is the data source that powers big, traffic-intense websites like [Node](https://nodejs.org), [JSR](https://jsr.io), [Tan Stack](https://tanstack.com), or [SolidJS](https://docs.solidjs.com).

By utilizing this data source, you can decide when to redeploy the index or only update a segment of it. Typically, you might set up a cron job to periodically update the index based on your needs. You also trigger deployments on demand.
