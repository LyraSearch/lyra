With Orama Cloud, you can upload a CSV file as a data source. This feature is particularly useful when you want to integrate Orama Cloud with a database dump, a spreadsheet export, or you don't want to use a plugin or a custom integration.

When you need to update your index with new data, you can simply upload a new CSV file with the updated data. If you think you will need to update your index frequently, you might want to consider using a [custom integration](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations), like the [Rest APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis) or [Remote JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/remote-json) data sources.

### Prerequisites

In this guide, we will show you how to import a CSV file to Orama Cloud and how to integrate it into your app.
You can follow along with this guide by downloading the following example CSV file.

## Creating the index

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">As always, you can create a new index by visiting your <a href="https://cloud.orama.com/indexes" target="_blank">dashboard</a>.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">In this page click on the `Add new index` button and choose: `Import Data from files`.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Of course, you can choose any name and description you want for your index.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">After selecting "**CSV File**" as a data source, we can click on the "**Create Index**" button.</p>

        alt="Choosing the CSV data source on Orama Cloud"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">At this point, we can upload our CSV file by dragging and dropping it into the dedicated area, or by clicking on the "Choose a file" area and selecting the file from our computer.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">As soon as we do that, we will see the preview of the CSV file, which will help us write the [Searchable Properties](/cloud/working-with-indexes/searchable-schema) schema for our index.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/writing-the-schema.png"
        alt="Writing the searchable properties schema"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">By default, the **automatic embeddings generation** will be enabled with all the searchable properties of type `string`.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">You can change the properties by clicking on them and selecting only the ones you want to be searchable when performing a vector search or answer generation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Click on "**Save and deploy**" to release your index.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/working-with-indexes/deploy.png"
        alt="Deploying Orama"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">Done ðŸŽ‰ - You just deployed your CSV file on the edge. You can now start integrating it into your app.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
