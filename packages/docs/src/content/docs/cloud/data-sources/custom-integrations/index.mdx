Orama Cloud provides a growing number of [native integrations](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations) with popular CMSs, eCommerce platforms, and other web applications.

Even though, if you want to integrate and connect Orama Cloud to a proprietary or custom software, you can use our **custom integration** options to feed Orama Cloud with your data.

## How it works

When you need to regularly update the Orama Cloud index for production-grade workflows, or on a demand basis, we highly recommend considering feeding your index via [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis). 

If you have the data available in a JSON format and you can provide a URL endpoint to fetch the data, you can use the [Remote JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/remote-json) data source.

<Aside>
If you just want to feed your **custom data** by uploading a file, you can use the [Static Files](/cloud/data-sources/static-files) data sources, which is recommended for testing purposes, small datasets, or one-time imports.

### Deployments 

When using a **Custom Integration** data source, you can choose when to redeploy the entire index or update only a specific segment.

Typically, you might set up a cron job to periodically update the index based on your needs. You can also trigger deployments on demand.
