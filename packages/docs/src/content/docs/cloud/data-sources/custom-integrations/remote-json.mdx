Another way to use Orama Cloud and get your data indexed is to import the data using a remote JSON data source.

In this example I will be using a project I created that already has an API endpoint at: [https://letsplayretro.games/api/nes/all](https://letsplayretro.games/api/nes/all?results=999), this particular endpoint gathers all the games for the original [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) into one nice JSON structure.

To start indexing this data let's go into the dashboard and click on `Add a new Index` and then on `HTTP Integrations`:

<img

  alt='Create a new index with Orama Cloud'
/>

You will be presented with a page that asks some questions about your new index and like the name and an optional description, in my case I named the index `NES Games` but you may call it anything.
After that is done you can click on `Remote JSON` and we are ready to create our Index:

<img
  src='/cloud/guides/rest/2.png'
  alt='Create a new Remote JSON index with Orama Cloud'
/>

This page is where we will tell Orama the location of the Endpoint we want it to get the data from, and we want to use the data at [https://letsplayretro.games/api/nes/all](https://letsplayretro.games/api/nes/all?results=999), in our case the endpoint does not require any authorization but if it did this where you could give us a header to send in the request.

The next step is to tell Orama where our documents are in the Endpoint's JSON, if you open the endpoint you can see they are all in an array called `games`, so in our path we want to get everything inside of `games`, to represent that in JSONPath we write `$.games.*`.

The final step before we deploy our Index is to specify the properties that Orama should consider when performing a search.
This doesn't mean that these properties will be the only ones returned, but rather that when searching for a specific term like "mario", Orama will only search within these properties.
In our case, we only want to use the `name` property, which is a string. Let's add that and we will be ready to deploy our index:

<img
  src='/cloud/guides/rest/3.png'
  alt='Deploy your index'
/>

After waiting a bit we should get back a success message and our API Key and Endpoint that we can use within our app.

<img
  src='/cloud/guides/rest/4.png'
  alt='Deployed index'
/>

That's it! We have deployed an index with a REST API data source.

## Integrating into your app

Now that you have your index deployed, you can start using it in your app.

Orama Cloud provides an official SDK for JavaScript that runs on every JavaScript runtime. You can use it to query your data.

To learn more about the SDK, check out the [documentation](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/javascript-sdk).
