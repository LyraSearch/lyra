Another way to integrate with Orama Cloud and get your data indexed is feeding the data using a Remote JSON data source. 

This data source expects a JSON response from an API endpoint URL that you provide. You can also optionally specify an authorization header to send with the request.

## Usage

In this example we will be using a demo API endpoint at <a href="https://dummyjson.com/products" target="_blank">dummyjson.com/products</a>, this endpoint returns a data structure like this:

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Essence Mascara Lash Princess",
      "description": "The Essence Mascara Lash Princess is a popular mascara known for its volumizing and lengthening effects. Achieve dramatic lashes with this long-lasting and cruelty-free formula.",
      "category":"beauty",
      "price":9.99,
      "discountPercentage":7.17,
      "rating":4.94,
      "stock":5,
      "tags":["beauty","mascara"],
      "brand":"Essence",
      "sku":"RCH45Q1A",
      "weight":2,
      "dimensions":{
        "width":23.17,
        "height":14.43,
        "depth":28.01
        },
      "warrantyInformation":"1 month warranty",
      "shippingInformation":"Ships in 1 month",
      "availabilityStatus":"Low Stock",
      "reviews":[
        {
          "rating":2,
          "comment":"Very unhappy with my purchase!",
          "date":"2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
          "reviewerName":"John Doe",
          "reviewerEmail":"john.doe@x.dummyjson.com"
        },
        {
          "rating":5,
          "comment":"Very satisfied!",
          "date":"2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
          "reviewerName":"Scarlett Wright",
          "reviewerEmail":"scarlett.wright@x.dummyjson.com"
        }
      ],
      "returnPolicy":"30 days return policy",
      "minimumOrderQuantity":24,
      "meta": {
        "createdAt":"2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
        "updatedAt":"2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
        "barcode":"9164035109868",
        "qrCode":"https://assets.dummyjson.com/public/qr-code.png"
      },
      "images":["https://cdn.dummyjson.com/products/images/beauty/Essence%20Mascara%20Lash%20Princess/1.png"],
      "thumbnail":"https://cdn.dummyjson.com/products/images/beauty/Essence%20Mascara%20Lash%20Princess/thumbnail.png"
    },
    // More products...
  ]
}
```

## Creating an index

To start indexing this data let's go into the <a href="https://cloud.orama.com" target="_blank">dashboard</a> and click on `Add a new Index` and then on `HTTP Integrations`.

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">You will be presented with a page that asks some questions about your new index and like the name and an optional description.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">Select Remote JSON as the data source and click `Create Index` to continue.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/rest/2.png"
        alt="Create a new Remote JSON index with Orama Cloud"
        class="mx-10"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">This page is where we will tell Orama the location of the Endpoint we want it to get the data from, and we want to use the data at <a href="https://dummyjson.com/products" target="_blank">dummyjson.com/products</a>, in our case the endpoint does not require any authorization but if it did this where you could configure a header to send in the request.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/rest/3.png"
        alt="Deploy your index"
        class="mx-10"
      />
      <p class="pl-10">The next step is to tell Orama where our documents are in the Endpoint's JSON. If you open the <a href="https://dummyjson.com/products" target="_blank">endpoint</a> you can see they are all inside an array called `products`, so in our path we want to get everything inside of `products`, to represent that in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONPath" target="_blank">JSONPath</a> we write `$.products.*`.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">The final step before we deploy our Index is to specify the properties that Orama should consider when performing a search.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">This doesn"t mean that these properties will be the only ones returned, but rather that when searching for a specific term like "**Mascara**", Orama will only search within these properties.</p>
      <p class="pl-10">In our case, we only want to use the `title` property, which is a **string**. Let's add that and you will be ready to deploy your index.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/rest/3.png"
        alt="Deploy your index"
        class="mx-10"
      />
      <p class="pl-10">_(Optional)_ In a more complex scenario, you could add more properties like `description`, `category`, `tags`, `brand`, `sku`, `meta`, etc. See the example below for reference.</p>
      <div class="pl-10">
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "price": "number",
  "rating": "number",
  "stock": "number",
  "tags": "string[]",
  "brand": "string",
  "sku": "string",
  "meta": {
    "barcode": "string",
  }
}
```
      </div>
      <p class="pl-10">Click "**Save and Deploy**" to start your first deployment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="pl-10">After the deployment is complete, you should get back a success message and the **Endpoint URL** and **Public API Key** that we can use within your app.</p>
      <img
        src="/cloud/guides/rest/4.png"
        alt="Deployed index"
        class="mx-10"
      />
      <p class="pl-10">That's it! ðŸŽ‰ You have deployed an index with a **Remote JSON** data source.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Check out the logs displayed in the dashboard to see if there are any errors. Firstly, verify that the endpoint URL is correct and accessible.
Make sure that the JSON response is valid and that the JSONPath is correct. If you are still having trouble, please reach out to our [Slack](https://orama.to/slack) for support.
