Orama is an answer engine. When you integrate your data, it will create a complete **RAG pipeline** to let you ask questions about your data and get precise, reliable answers back.

To get started with the Orama Answer Engine, simply [create a new index](/cloud/working-with-indexes/create-a-new-index). Orama will automatically generate embeddings for your data and create a pipeline that will let your users ask questions about your data and get answers back.

## Quality Checks

With our researchers, we built a system that runs quality checks on the data and the embeddings to ensure that the answers are reliable and precise. This is a **continuous process** to prevent hallucinations such as incorrect informations or missing details, and we are always working to improve the quality of the answers.

For this reason, we're confident that we are offering the best answer engine on the market right now. We're so confident that we offer a FREE plan that lets you perform unlimited search queries and answer generations. We know that you'll love it. ðŸ’œ
