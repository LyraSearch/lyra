Orama is an answer engine. When you integrate your data, it will create a complete **RAG pipeline** to let you ask questions about your data and get precise, reliable answers back.

To get started with the Orama Answer Engine, simply [create a new index](/cloud/working-with-indexes/create-a-new-index). Orama will automatically generate embeddings for your data and create a pipeline that will let you ask questions about your data and get answers back.

With our researchers, we built a system that runs quality checks on the data and the embeddings to ensure that the answers are reliable and precise. This is a **continuous process**, and we are always working to improve the quality of the answers.
