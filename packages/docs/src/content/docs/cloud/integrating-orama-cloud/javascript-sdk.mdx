Orama Cloud provides an official JavaScript SDK to help you integrate your indexes into your JavaScript application.

## Installation

You can install the SDK using `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or any other package manager of your choice:

<Install pkg="@oramacloud/client" />

When developing using Deno, you can import the SDK using the `npm` namespace:

```typescript copy
import { OramaClient } from "npm:@oramacloud/client";
```

This SDK aims to be 100% compatible with every JavaScript environment, including Node.js, Deno, Bun, and browsers.

## Usage

The SDK provides an `OramaClient` class that you can use to interact with the Orama Cloud API.

From there, you can connect to the Orama Cloud API and start making requests:

```typescript copy
import { OramaClient } from "@oramacloud/client";

const client = new OramaClient({
  endpoint: "YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL",
  api_key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY",
});
```

You can always find your public API key and endpoint in the Orama Dashboard. Here is an example of what it looks like:

<img
  src='/cloud/guides/javascript-sdk/orama-api-key.png'
  alt='Orama Index Dashboard'
/>

Remember, the API key and endpoint are public, so you can safely include them in your frontend application.

## Performing a full-text search query

The Orama Cloud SDK wraps the [open source search method](/open-source/usage/search/introduction), maintaining backward compatibility with the [Open Source API](/open-source/usage/search/introduction).

```typescript copy
import { OramaClient } from "@oramacloud/client";

const client = new OramaClient({
  endpoint: "YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL",
  api_key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY",
});

const results = await client.search({
  term: "red shoes",
  where: {
    price: {
      gt: 99.99,
    },
  },
});
```
