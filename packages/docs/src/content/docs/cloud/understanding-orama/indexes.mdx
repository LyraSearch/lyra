An Orama index is essentially a collection of Orama documents that share a common schema.

## Usage limits

## Search and AI limits

Regardless of your subscription, you can perform an **unlimited number of search queries and answers generations** on your indexes.

## Deployments limits

On the free plan, you have 150 index updates per month. An index update is a successful deployment performed on an index. Deployments are to be considered globally, meaning that if you have 5 indexes and deploy all of them simultaneously, it will count as 5 deployments.

## Index Types

Orama Cloud integrates natively with different data sources.

Every native integration between Orama Cloud and an external data source will lead to a highly optimized index,
where the main purpose is to provide a fast and reliable search experience, with minimal configuration.

### Native Integrations

Orama Cloud integrates natively with many different data sources, including:

- [Shopify](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify)
- [ElasticPath](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath)
- [Docusaurus](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus)

And many more to come.

### Custom Integrations

You can always create a custom integration with your own data source. Orama Cloud currently supports the following data sources:

- [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis) \
  You can index data via REST APIs. Orama Cloud will reindex the data every time the `deploy` API is triggered.
- [Remote JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/remote-json) \
  You can index data from a REST API. Orama Cloud will periodically fetch the data from the API and index it.
- [JSON File](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/json-file) \
  You can upload a JSON file to Orama Cloud, and it will be indexed automatically.
- [CSV File](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/csv-file) \
  You can upload a CSV file to Orama Cloud, and it will be indexed automatically.
