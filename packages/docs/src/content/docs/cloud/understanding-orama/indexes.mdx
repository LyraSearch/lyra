An Orama index is essentially a collection of Orama documents that share a common schema.

Depending on your subscription, you may have more or less limitations when it comes to indexes.

| Subscription | Max. Indexes | Max. Documents per index | Total deployments per month | Price per month                          |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Free         | 3            | 100,000                  | 150                         | $0                                       |
| Hobby        | 10           | 250,000                  | 500                         | $49                                      |

Regardless of your subscription, you can perform an unlimited number of search queries and answers generations on your indexes.

Deployments are to be considered globally, meaning that if you have 5 indexes and deploy all of them simultaneously, it will count as 5 deployments.

## Index Types

Orama Cloud integrates natively with different data sources.

Every native integration between Orama Cloud and an external data source will lead to a highly optimized index,
where the main purpose is to provide a fast and reliable search experience, with minimal configuration.

### Native Integrations

Orama Cloud integrates natively with many different data sources, including:

- [Shopify](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify)
- [ElasticPath](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath)
- [Docusaurus](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus)

And many more to come.

### Custom Integrations

You can always create a custom integration with your own data source. Orama Cloud currently supports the following data sources:

- [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis) \
  You can index data via REST APIs. Orama Cloud will reindex the data every time the `deploy` API is triggered.
- [Remote JSON](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/remote-json) \
  You can index data from a REST API. Orama Cloud will periodically fetch the data from the API and index it.
- [JSON File](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/json-file) \
  You can upload a JSON file to Orama Cloud, and it will be indexed automatically.
- [CSV File](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/csv-file) \
  You can upload a CSV file to Orama Cloud, and it will be indexed automatically.
