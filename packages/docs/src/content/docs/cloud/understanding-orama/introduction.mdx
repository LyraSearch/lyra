Orama Cloud brings **Orama** to the next level.

In just a few minutes, you can deploy a new [Orama index](/cloud/understanding-orama/indexes) to **300** global locations in **100** countries all over the world. This allows Orama to be extremely fast, resilient, and scalable.

Not only Orama Cloud makes Orama available worldwide, but it also provides a wide range of features that are hard to find all-in-one in other solutions.

Its numerous features include:

- Full-text search
- Vector search
- Hybrid search
- Answer sessions
- Answers and search quality checks
- Stemming and tokenizing in 30 languages
- Geosearch
- Query filters
- Facets
- Groups
- Custom sorting rules
- A robust plugin system
- Fields boosting
- Typo tolerance
- Synonyms (coming soon!)

And much more.

## Comparing Orama with other solutions

Orama, specifically Orama Cloud, is a unique answer engine that provides a wide range of features that are hard to find all-in-one in other solutions.

In a real-world scenario, you might need to use multiple services to achieve the same results that Orama Cloud provides.

For example, you may want to use a full-text search engine like ElasticSearch, Algolia, or Meilisearch for full-text search, and a vector search engine like Milvus, Pinecone, or Weaviate for vector search.

Then, you would have to use a third-party service like OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft for answer sessions.

But once you created this whole infrastructure, you would also have to test its efficiency, scalability, and resilience.

Not only Orama Cloud provides all these features in one place, but it also runs daily quality checks on your generated answers and search results, making sure that your users get the best possible experience.

This aims to avoid hallucinations as much as possible, a common problem with generative models, and to provide the most accurate and relevant answers to your users.

So when using Orama Cloud, you're not choosing just a search engine or a vector database. You're choosing a complete answer engine that provides a wide range of features that are hard to build, maintain, and scale on your own.

## Understanding the concept of indexes

Orama is an immutable search engine, which means that once your indexes are deployed, they remain unchanged until the next deployment.

But what is an index? And how can you update it while in production? Find out in [the next section](/cloud/understanding-orama/indexes).
