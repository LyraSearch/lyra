### Search and AI limits

Regardless of your subscription, you can perform an unlimited number of [search queries](/cloud/performing-search/) and [embeddings generations](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation) on your indexes.

### Deployments limits

The Free plan includes *150 index updates per month*. An index update is a **successful deployment** performed on an index. Deployments are to be considered globally, meaning that if you have 3 indexes and deploy all of them simultaneously, it will count as 3 deployments.

If a deployment fails, it will not be counted towards your monthly limit.

### Analytics retention limits

Analytics are included in all plans, with a retention period of 60 days for the Free plan, 365 days for the Pro and Premium plans, and a custom retention period for the Enterprise plan.

## Features

The following features are available on all plans, including the Free plan. Some features may have limitations depending on your current subscription.

### Data sources

You can create indexes through many different [datasources](/cloud/data-sources/introduction-to-data-sources). You can upload a [static file](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/json-file), install one of the supported [native plugins](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/), or build your own custom integration via [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis).

All datasources are available on all plans.

### Answer Engine

Orama Cloud's [Answer Engine](/cloud/answer-engine/) is available on all plans. You can create an unlimited number of [answer sessions](/cloud/answer-engine/creating-an-answer-session) and generate an unlimited number of answers.
