- 🧩 **Native** and **Custom** integrations to easily import your data.
- 🚀 **Web Components** to easily integrate a full-featured Searchbox on your website in no time.
- 📊 **Quality checks**, analytics and quality control tools to fine-tune your users experience.
- 🔐 **Secure proxy** configuration and advanced security options.
- and much more...

### Basic concepts

At the core of Orama Cloud, there are three simple concepts:

- 📖 **Index**: a collection of documents that you can search through.
- 📄 **Schema**: a set of rules that define how the documents are structured.
- 🗿 **Immutability**: once you've created an index and populated it with documents, it will remain immutable. To change the content of an index, you have to perform a re-deployment.

With your index, you can perform full-text, vector, and hybrid search queries, as well as generative conversations. [Add your data](/cloud/data-sources/introduction-to-data-sources), define the schema, and you're ready to go!
