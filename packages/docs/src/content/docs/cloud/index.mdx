Orama is a fast, high-quality, batteries-included product answer engine.

With Orama Cloud, you can perform unlimited full-text, vector, and hybrid search queries as well as unlimited generative conversations for a flat rate, which can vary depending on your plan.

Orama Cloud offers a generous free plan that allows you to perform all the actions described above completely for free.

## Base Concepts

When we say that Orama Cloud is batteries-included, we mean that it gives you everything you need to start searching and generating answers (conversations) without any complex configurations.

At the basis of Orama Cloud, there are three simple elements:

- **Index**: A collection of documents that you can search through.
- **Schema**: A set of rules that define how the documents in the index are structured.
- **Immutability**: Once you've created an index and populated it with documents, it will remain immutable. To change the content of an index, you have to perform a redeployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with Orama Cloud, you will need to create a new account at [https://cloud.orama.com](https://cloud.orama.com) (no credit card needed!) and then follow the instructions in the [working with indexes](/cloud/working-with-indexes/create-a-new-index) guide.
