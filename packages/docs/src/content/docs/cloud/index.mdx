## Introduction

When we say that Orama Cloud is batteries-included, we mean that it gives you everything you need to start searching and generating answers (conversations) without any complex configurations.
Out of the box, Orama Cloud also includes:

- **Web Components** to easily integrate a full-featured Searchbox on your website in no time.
- **Quality check** and quality control tools to fine-tune your users AI interactions experience.
- **Secure proxy** configuration and advanced security options.
- and much more...

### Basic Concepts

At the core of Orama Cloud, there are three simple concepts:

- **Index**: A collection of documents that you can search through.
- **Schema**: A set of rules that define how the documents in the index are structured.
- **Immutability**: Once you've created an index and populated it with documents, it will remain immutable. To change the content of an index, you have to perform a redeployment.

### Create your first index

To get started, you will need to [create a new account](https://cloud.orama.com) (no credit card needed!) and then follow the instructions in the [working with indexes](/cloud/working-with-indexes/create-a-new-index) guide.
