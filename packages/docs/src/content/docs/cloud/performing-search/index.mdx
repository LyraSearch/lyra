Once your data is imported and your index is up and running, you can start performing search queries using one our Official SDKs. Orama offers SDKs for [JavaScript](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/official-sdk), [Swift](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/official-sdk), [Kotlin](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/official-sdk), [PHP](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/official-sdk) and [Python](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/official-sdk). 

The Official SDKs are the recommended way to communicate with Orama Cloud, providing out of the box connection management, cache, telemetry, and type safety for all your search operations.

## Quick start

You can install the Javascript SDK using `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, or any other package manager of your choice:

<Install pkg="@oramacloud/client" />

When developing using Deno, you can import the SDK using the `npm` namespace:

```typescript copy
import { OramaClient } from "npm:@oramacloud/client";
```

This SDK aims to be 100% compatible with every JavaScript environment, including Node.js, Deno, Bun, and browsers.

The SDK provides an `OramaClient` class that you can use to interact with the Orama Cloud API.

From there, you can connect to the Orama Cloud API and start making requests:

```typescript copy
import { OramaClient } from "@oramacloud/client";

const client = new OramaClient({
  endpoint: "YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL",
  api_key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY",
});
```
