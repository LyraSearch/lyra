You can execute search queries using one our Official SDKs. Orama offers SDKs for JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, PHP and Python. 

The Official SDKs are the recommended way to communicate with Orama Cloud, providing out of the box connection management, cache, telemetry, and type safety for all your search operations.

<Aside type="tip" title='Installing the Orama SDK'>
You can find the guide on installing the SDK [here](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/javascript-sdk).

Make sure you have the Orama SDK installed to start performing full-text, vector, and hybrid search at a massive scale!
