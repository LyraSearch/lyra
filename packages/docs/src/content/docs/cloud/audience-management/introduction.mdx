Audience management is a feature that allows you to create and manage user segments and triggers.

You can think of user segments as **"Personas"** or **"Audiences"** that you can define based on user attributes, events, or other criteria. You can then use these segments to target users with personalized answers, content, campaigns, or other actions.

Orama allows you to create user segments and triggers on all of your indexes.

To use these features, you'll first need to [create an index](/cloud/working-with-indexes/create-a-new-index) and learn [how to use Orama answer engine features](/cloud/answer-engine/introduction).
