# Native Integrations

With Orama, you can integrate with every external system, library, and API.

While we let you build your own integrations via our **custom integrations** feature, we also provide a set of native integrations that you can use out of the box.

At the time of writing this, we have the following native integrations:

- [**Shopify**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify)
- [**Docusaurus**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus) (Coming soon)
- [**Nextra**](/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/nextra) (Coming soon)

When available, we suggest using native integrations over custom integrations, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

We're working on adding more native integrations, so if you have any suggestions, please let us know at [info@oramasearch.com](mailto:info@oramasearch.com)!
