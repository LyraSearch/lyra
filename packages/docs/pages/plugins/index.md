# Plugin system

Since the beginning of the project, Orama has been developed thinking of a simple way to add new features via a plugin system, leaving the core as small as possible.

The Orama core team is currently working on hooks, allowing the community to interact with the Orama processes easily.

That said, the Orama core team is working on some official plugins to support specific features that might not be useful for the general public. That way, you will be able to bring in only the features you really need.

All the official plugins' source code is hosted under the [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama) monorepo, in the [`packages`](https://github.com/oramasearch/orama/packages) directory.
