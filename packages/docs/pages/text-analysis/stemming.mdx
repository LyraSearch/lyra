# Stemming

By default, Orama analyzes the input and performs a `stemming` operation, which allows the engine to perform more optimized queries, as well as save indexing space.

<Callout type='info' >
In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base, or root formâ€”generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation.

By default, Orama uses **the English language analyzer**, but we can override this behavior by setting the property `defaultLanguage` at database initialization, and importing a custom stemmer:

```javascript copy
import { create } from '@orama/orama'
import { stemmer } from '@orama/orama/stemmer/it'

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: 'string',
    quote: 'string',
  },
  defaultLanguage: 'italian',
  components: {
    tokenizer: {
      stemmingFn: stemmer,
    },
  },
})
```

Right now, Orama supports 26 languages and stemmers out of the box:

- Arabic
- Armenian
- Bulgarian
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Greek
- Hindi
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Irish
- Italian
- Nepali
- Norwegian
- Portuguese
- Romanian
- Russian
- Serbian
- Slovenian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Turkish
- Ukrainian

## Disabling stemming

You can disable stemming by setting `enableStemming: false` while initializing a new Orama instance:

```javascript copy
import { create } from '@orama/orama'

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: 'string',
    quote: 'string',
  },
  defaultLanguage: 'italian',
  components: {
    tokenizer: {
      enableStemming: false,
    },
  },
})
```
