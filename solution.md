I see that you are using the Orama search library and facing issues with typo tolerance when searching local chat messages. To address this problem, you can try adjusting the typo tolerance settings and experimenting with other parameters.

**Increase the Typo Tolerance Level:**

In your example, you mentioned using **tolerance: 1**. To allow for more significant typos, you can increase the tolerance level, e.g., **tolerance: 2** or higher. This will make the search more forgiving of typos.
**Tokenization and Stemming:**

Make sure that the tokenizer and stemming options are set correctly for your use case. Tokenization splits text into words or tokens, and stemming reduces words to their root form. Adjusting these settings can impact the search results.
**Partial Matching:**

Consider enabling partial matching. This allows the search to match portions of words, which can help when dealing with typos. In your example, **you can try setting partial: true**.
**Custom Dictionary**:

Depending on your use case, you might consider creating a custom dictionary of common typos and their correct versions. You can then preprocess the search terms to replace known typos with the correct spellings before sending the query to Orama.
**Query Expansion:**

Implement query expansion to automatically include common variations or synonyms of search terms. For example, if a user searches for "Chris," you can expand it to include "Christopher" as well.
**Analyze the Data:**

Examine the data in your local chat messages to identify common typos and variations. This can help you fine-tune your tolerance settings and preprocessing.
Testing and Iteration:

**Here's an updated version of your code:**

const result = await orama.search({
  term: "Cris",
  properties: ["director"],
  tolerance: 2, 
  partial: true,
});

console.log("Result:", result);
